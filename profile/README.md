# Welcome to SymOntoClay 👋

## About

**SymOntoClay** is a domain-specific scripting language and AI engine for defining game character behavior. 
It combines imperative constructs with logic programming, HTN planning, fuzzy logic, and event-driven triggers, offering a maximally declarative and human-readable syntax.

It adheres to high standards of **expressiveness**, **modularity**, and **extensibility**, drawing inspiration from both programming language theory and AI research. 
The design principles ensure the following benefits:
* **Declarativity**: behavior is described at a high level, reducing boilerplate and making scripts more readable.
* **Expressiveness**: complex reasoning, planning, and reactive mechanisms can be captured concisely.
* **Extensibility**: modular architecture allows adding new logic operators, triggers, or planning strategies without breaking existing code.

SymOntoClay integrates with Unity as open-source components.
It provides support for Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) and knowledge-based reasoning, enabling developers to create NPCs with predictable, consistent, and intelligent behavior.
